In this project i was responsible for `front-end development`. The initial idea of this application is to make for Sun Yat-Sen university the `app`, that allows each university member to reserve a seat in the school bus(shuttle buses between the campuses). So i need to consider factors such as beautiful `UI`, `creativity`, to `add` elements which are represents our school (logo,campus pictures,theme color), so while experiencing the usage of our app, the user can feel comfortable.  
To develop the front-end i've gone through a lot of tutorials, how to develop, analyze the requirements etc. To pick the right theme color, to make it looks natural, have to use the right `RGB` of our school theme color, so like this every small and big details in front-end development was taken into consideration. Besides that, there is a lot to learn about how to code in java and write xml files. I really enjoyed the team-work, it is much more efficient way of learning new things, while communicating with your teammates, you can share the ideas and the collaboration benefits everyone, because large task is devided into small groups of tasks, which is required very narrowed knowledge , but you still have to have the idea,the whole picture of that project, even if you are not responsible for that part, that is when team work and discussions useful.
